            <h3>IMPORTANT NOTE</h3>    
            <p>Please note that this study is just have a learning Phase: The whole phase will almost take 30 minutes. You will only receive     
            payment if you complete the study. Furthermore, data quality is crucial for us: If data checks indicate implausible response patterns or that    
            you were not paying attention to the task, this may have a negative impact on your Prolific rating. However, don t worry that you will not be able to fullfil     
            the requirements - we will tell you exactly what to do and if you follow the instructions, you will meet the quality criteria easily.</p>

            <h2>Detailed Information</h2>   
            <h3>1. Aim and Selection</h3>   
            This experiment is referred to as a research project throughout. If you participate in this research project, you are a participant.    
            In this research project, we want to investigate why some things are more learnable than others. We are asking you to participate in this project     
            because anyone aged 18-35 can participate.   
   
            <h3>2. General Information</h3>   
             The purpose of this study is to understand how human Learn things. We are interested in understanding why some things are more memorable than others.     
            For example, an image may stand out to you more because you know the person shown in that image and so are more likely to remember it. Therefore, by     
            participating in this experiment you will help to increase our general understanding of how memory works and specifically what your brain chooses to    
            remember. This research project is being conducted in line with regulations and laws. We also follow all internationally recognised guidelines and the     
            responsible ethics committee has reviewed and evaluated this research project.   
   
            <h3>3. Procedure</h3>   
            The procedure is the same for all participants.
            You have to learn some hidden connections. Learning session will last no longer than 30 minutes. 
            <h3>4. Benefits</h3>   
            Other than the compensation you receive, there is no direct benefit to you from participating this study. The investigator, however, may learn     
            more about human memory, so you are contributing to scientific progress and society may benefit from the knowledge that is acquired in this experiment.   
   
            <h3>5. Voluntary Participation and Obligations</h3>   
            You are participating voluntarily. If you do not wish to participate in this research project or wish to withdraw your participation later you may     
            do so without justification. If you participate in this experiment, you are asked to adhere to the specifications and requirements of the research     
            project throughout.   
   
            <h3>6. Risks and Burdens</h3>   
            The research project does not expose you to any risks.   
   
            <h3>7. Results</h3>   
            If you are interested, we can inform you about the overall results once the research project has finished.   
   
            <h3>8. Confidentiality of data</h3>   
            <h4>8.1. Data processing and encryption</h4>   
            The legal basis for processing your data is provided by your voluntary consent to participate in this research project (Art. 6(1)(c) DSGVO). This     
            research project is hosted on a secure internet connection (with a https certificate) and data are stored on a DGVSO compliant server under the     
            administration of the IT department at the Central Institute of Mental Health.<br>   
            In this research project, Dr Gordon Feld, <a href =  mailto: Gordon.Feld@zi-mannheim.de  target= _blank >Gordon.Feld@zi-mannheim.de</a>, is     
            responsible for data processing.<br>   
            In this research project, data about you will be collected and processing, partly in automated form. During data collection, your data will be     
            encrypted. <br> 
            Encryption means that no information that could be used to identify you is stored (name, date of birth, etc.) and you will only be known     
            by a code (= pseudo-anonymised) and your Prolific ID. <br> 
            Your Prolific ID is only known to you, Prolific and the researchers involved in this study.     
            The personal data that you may provide (e.g., your personal email address due to contacting us via email instead of the anonymised Prolific     
            messaging system) will be securely and temporarily stored during any correspondence on a password protected email account hosted at the Central Institute of Mental Health under the administration of IT, which is DGVSO compliant.<br> 
            Once any correspondence is completed, the correspondence     
            alongside your email address will be deleted. People who do not have access to the data cannot identify you. The list of anonymised participants     
            always remains in the Department of Clinical Psychology, ZI, Mannheim.<br>   
            Only very few professionals will see your encrypted data, and only in order to perform tasks necessary within the research project. For example,     
            your Prolific ID will be used to award payment for completing the experiment. These persons are subject to the duty of confidentiality. As soon as    
            the research purposes permit it, your Prolific ID will be deleted, so it will not be possible to connect your data to your Prolific ID anymore. At     
            this point, the data will be anonymous. As a participant, you have the right to inspect and correct your data. Please note that this is only     
            possible as long as your Prolific ID has not yet been deleted, since at this point, we will not know which data belong to you anymore. The data     
            will be stored permanently, secured against unauthorised access, after the research project has ended or been discontinued. In addition, the     
            anonymised data is made available to other researchers in an internet-based research data bank called PsychArchives (Leibniz Institute of    
            Psychology (ZPID), <a href = https://leibniz-psychology.org/angebote/archivieren/>https://leibniz-psychology.org/angebote/archivieren/</a>, the     
            servers are located in Germany). In doing so, we follow the recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG), which recommends that all     
            anonymised data collected in this study be made available to the public. This is important to ensure quality assurance in terms of verifiability     
            and reproducibility of scientific results (e.g., results in publications) and to allow re-use of the data. Reproducibility means that other     
            researchers can check whether the results are correct and whether they would arrive at identical results.   
           
            <h4>8.2. Data Protection</h4>   
            All data protection requirements are strictly adhered to. It is possible that your data may have to be transferred in anonymised form to countries     
            outside the EU, for example for publication, and may be made available to other researchers. The same level of data protection cannot be guaranteed     
            abroad as in the EU. However, the data passed on is anonymised and can no longer be linked to your person.   
   
            <h3>9. Withdrawal from the Research Project</h3>   
            You can revoke your consent in writing or verbally at any time without giving reasons and without incurring any disadvantage. If you    
            revoke your consent, no further data will be collected. However, the data processing that took place until the revocation remains lawful.<br>   
            In the event of revocation, you can also request the deletion of your data. Please note that this is only possible if the list of anonymous Prolific     
            IDs has not yet been destroyed, as we will no longer be able to allocate your data from this point on.<br>   
            If you have any concerns about data processing and compliance with data protection requirements, you can also contact the following data     
            protection officer:

            <h3>10. Compensation for your time</h3>   
            If you complete the research project you will be compensated £4.00. In addition, you can receive extra payment    
            depending on your score in the task: Percentage will be calculated according to their score (Coins won in the task). Participants Scoring 90% or Higher will
             receive £6.00, If you score between 80% to 89.99% you will get £4.00.
   
            <h3>11. Funding</h3>
